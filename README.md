  * [Multibrot Set - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibrot_set)

## Features to Be Added:
* Parametrization of c (Julia sets yay!)
* Allowing negative values of p (skill issue bro just program the better negative exponent algorithm bro)
  * Allowing complex values of p?
    * Parametrization of p??? like in 2swap's video???
* FASTER LOADING TIMES FOR PETE'S SAKE
* May migrate to a Godot project?
